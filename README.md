This is my contribution for a project in C, at Ludwig-Maximilian-Universit√§t (LMU). We participated in teams of 4 to create a client for a nine man's morris game. The client is seperated into two processes, one for the communication with the server (the server was provided by the university), the other for "thinking", so analyzing the game board and choosing a move.

This contribution is a fully working client, not just a part of the software, which the word contribution might imply.
